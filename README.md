# continuous-integration
Continuous integration is a software development practice where a new code is joined to an existing code that is hosted in a repository. The union of codes comes with automatic execution of tests to ensure its correct operation[1]. The goal of continuous integration is to quickly detect and locate bugs, so reduce the time to fix and improve the software, and that updates are available as soon as possible. To carry out this workshop, you must use Jenkins as a continuous integration tool. Jenkins is Open Source and runs as a server on the host machine; In addition, it has numerous plugins that increase its capabilities. Additionally, you must use Ngrok, which is a tool that allows exposing a local url to a public url. For this workshop, Jenkins will run locally on your computer, by uploading the changes to our remote repository hosted on Github, it will be able to send a response to our server, so it is necessary to have a public url to expose our local server to the internet. Here Ngrok intervenes acting as a communication bridge between Github and Jenkins.
